-paramarker fixed
-added gearaccess at ammotrucks,increased price,made cutom marker
-failed adding gearaccess at ammobox,in a3 you can make it like ammotruck
maybe its other kind of object here

-failed implement the marker spawncode, seems there some function in which
a2 not know.canceled to search this problem

Markerclasses:HeliH		
	      HeliHRescue	
	      HeliHCivil

-canceled implement ECM, i used A3 funktion isEqualTypeArray in my code.
looking for downgrade code or rewriting this is a bit mindfuck.

-----------------------------------------------------------

i suggest asking in your discord for a3 community feedback.
if you organize some debugevents,maybe every last saturday in month or
such stuff with 10+ player,we can make the a3 build good enough to
get the full community on a3.just make a red text with the date
and servername in a2 server too,if you do,maybe im not the only one which
not is using discord.

a3 is not free to play atm but vanilla should 
be cheap enough maybe. i made it for vanilla is enough,so fuck this dlc
 shit there are nice free mods.idk just check out my build,if you get time for it.
in general everyone had better fps there, a2 is and stays a 32bit game.
